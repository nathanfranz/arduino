This is a simple device/program for a difficult portion of the game Final Fantasy X.

In the game there is a lightning strike that lights up the screen and the user has to quickly press a button to dodge the lightning.

This device uses a photoresistor to sense when the screen lights up and then uses a servo to press the button.
